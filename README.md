This repository creates a Dash application to visualise the availability of the various parking garages in Ghent (Belgium). 
The application is updated automatically, but users can also hit the 'Update' button. 

The data is available through the city council's API (https://data.stad.gent/explore/dataset/bezetting-parkeergarages-real-time). 
A running version of the webpage is available at http://erpohk.ddns.net/visualisaties/parkeergarages-gent/.
